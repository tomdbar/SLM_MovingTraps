# SLM_MovingTraps
Developing individually addressable atom-traps using a spatial light modulator.

This consists of an IPython notebook detailing how to move between the pattern put onto a spatial light modulator (slm) and the trapping plane for atoms.  The most efficient techniques for generating individually adressable atom traps are then discussed.
